# Raspberry Pi Setup Guide
### Written for Genspace's Open Plant Community Project

The goal of this guide is to create the minimal lowest cost setup for a Raspberry Pi (including associated peripherals) and fastest setup time, intended for new users to get up and running quickly.  

What you'll need (physically):
- Raspberry Pi 0 W
- microSD card (>= 4GB)
- 5V (2.5A) power supply
- computer with SD card reader

What you'll need (digitally), please download:
- [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
- Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian OS)
  - [ZIP](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_full_armhf_latest)
  - [TORRENT](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_full_armhf_latest.torrent)
    - NOTE: if you can torrent, that's much faster, the ZIP file seems to be speed limited no matter how fast your internet connection is
- Windows users: [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  - Choose 64-bit if your OS can support it, if you're not sure what you have, it's fine to use 32-bit then
